# Excel_comp_team104

## **PRODUCT NAME: CompareDiff**

With proper research, we’ve been able to identify the pain point of data analysts, accountants and many others who use excel files to execute daily tasks. CompDiff aims to `effortlessly compare` excel files, `search for duplicates` and even `highlight differences` within `a file` and even better, `two or more` files.
